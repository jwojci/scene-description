# scene-description
scene description for short videos using detectron2 from Meta, opencv and openai api <br />
the descriptions are generated by performing panoptic segmentation using detectron2 on every 15 frames of the passed in video <br />
then the information from the segmented frames is saved to a dict with corresponding frame number <br />
and that dict is passed into the open ai api in two prompts, one for background detections and one for foreground objects <br />
